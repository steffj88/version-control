When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

>>For safety and sharing

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it is impossible to know when I want something published, especially not every commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

>>Forks - no idea
>>Clone - copy of entire repository including commit history
>>Branch - separate commit history of the file(s) in question to enable commit history for various versions.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

>>No need for internet access, faster updates, full privacy.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

>>Sending files back and forth
>>Shared drives - quite easy if people have the right mindset for always storing and copying files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

>>To test out features or for collaboration.
